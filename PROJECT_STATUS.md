# Great Fire of Smyrna RAG System - Project Status

## Current State
**Status**: Working system with improved answer quality
**Last Updated**: January 6, 2025

## System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Main Entry Point**: `start_great_fire_server.py` - Launches the FastAPI server
- **API Server**: `great_fire_server.py` - FastAPI endpoints for question answering
- **QA Engine**: `hybrid_qa_system.py` - Core question answering logic
- **Database**: Neo4j graph database (`the-great-fire-db`)
- **LLM**: Local Ollama (mistral-small3.1:latest)

### Data Flow
1. Question received via FastAPI endpoint `/api/analyze`
2. `hybrid_qa_system.py` searches Neo4j for relevant context
3. Context sent to local Ollama for answer generation
4. Response returned in conversational narrative style

## Recent Improvements (January 2025)

### Fixed Repetitive Answers Issue
**Problem**: Answers were getting stuck in repetitive loops
**Solution**: 
- Reduced aggressive repetition penalties in Ollama parameters
- Changed `frequency_penalty` from 1.0 â†’ 0.8
- Changed `presence_penalty` from 0.6 â†’ 0.4  
- Increased `temperature` from 0.4 â†’ 0.6
- Removed problematic `repeat_penalty` parameter

### Improved Answer Style
**Goal**: Natural narrative prose instead of wiki-style lists
**Implementation**:
- Updated system prompt to emphasize flowing narrative
- Modified user prompts to avoid bullet points/lists
- Focused on storytelling approach while maintaining accuracy

## Database Schema

### Neo4j Nodes
- **Character**: Historical figures (AtatÃ¼rk, Jennings, Bristol, etc.)
- **Episode**: Story segments with narrative context
- **Event**: Historical events with timeline information
- **Entity**: General entities and concepts

### Neo4j Relationships
- **RELATES_TO**: Connections between entities with context
- **MENTIONS**: Links between episodes and entities

- Frequency Penalty: 0.8
- Presence Penalty: 0.4

## Server Details
- **Port**: 8002
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0
- **Main Endpoint**: `/api/analyze`
- **Health Check**: `/api/health`
- **Capabilities**: `/api/capabilities`

## Goals & Next Steps

### Current Goals
1. âœ… Fix repetitive answer generation
2. âœ… Improve answer quality and style
3. ðŸ”„ Set up version control and documentation
4. ðŸ“‹ Maintain system stability

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Enhance entity search algorithms
- [ ] Add more sophisticated context ranking
- [ ] Implement answer caching for common queries
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Expand database with additional historical sources

## Historical Context
The system specializes in analyzing "The Great Fire of Smyrna" (1922), focusing on:
- Character relationships and development
- Historical events and their consequences  
- International diplomatic interactions
- Humanitarian crisis and relief efforts
- Cultural and political tensions of the period

## Technical Notes
- Uses hybrid approach: Neo4j manual search + Ollama generation
- Graphiti integration available but currently disabled
- Prioritizes authoritative character profiles over episode content
- Supports various query types: factual, analytical, relationship-based
