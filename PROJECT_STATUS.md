# Great Fire of Smyrna RAG System - Project Status

## Current State
**Status**: Hybrid semantic search system with Graphiti integration
**Last Updated**: January 13, 2025
**Current Branch**: `graphiti-integration`

## System Architecture

### Core Components
- **Main Entry Point**: `start_great_fire_server.py` - Launches FastAPI server with health checks
- **API Server**: `great_fire_server.py` - Enhanced FastAPI endpoints with metadata tracking
- **QA Engine**: `hybrid_qa_system.py` - Hybrid semantic search with Graphiti + Neo4j fallback
- **Database**: Neo4j graph database (`the-great-fire-db`) with Graphiti semantic layer
- **LLM**: Local Ollama (mistral-small3.1:latest) for answer generation
- **Semantic Search**: Graphiti with OpenAI embeddings for conceptual understanding

### Data Flow (Hybrid Mode)
1. Question received via FastAPI endpoint `/api/analyze`
2. Query type detection for analysis categorization
3. **Primary**: Graphiti semantic search with OpenAI embeddings
4. **Fallback**: Enhanced Neo4j manual search with character profiling
5. Intelligent batch compression for large content
6. Context sent to local Ollama for answer generation
7. Response with comprehensive metadata tracking

## Recent Improvements (January 2025)

### Graphiti Semantic Search Integration
**Achievement**: Hybrid search architecture with intelligent fallback
**Implementation**:
- Integrated Graphiti with OpenAI embeddings for semantic understanding
- Automatic fallback to Neo4j manual search when semantic fails
- Query type detection for optimized search strategies
- Thematic analysis capabilities for complex historical patterns

### Enhanced Compression & Performance
**Problem**: Large content causing timeouts and poor performance
**Solution**:
- Intelligent batch episode compression (max 2 episodes vs 4)
- Query-specific relevance filtering during compression
- Character profile preservation (uncompressed for accuracy)
- Streamlined token limits for faster response times

### Fixed Repetitive Answers Issue
**Problem**: Answers were getting stuck in repetitive loops
**Solution**: 
- Reduced aggressive repetition penalties in Ollama parameters
- Changed `frequency_penalty` from 1.0 â†’ 0.8
- Changed `presence_penalty` from 0.6 â†’ 0.4  
- Increased `temperature` from 0.4 â†’ 0.6
- Removed problematic `repeat_penalty` parameter

### Improved Metadata Tracking
**Problem**: Inconsistent footer display and metadata capture
**Solution**:
- Complete separation of metadata tracking from content processing
- Enhanced query type detection (general, character_analysis, themes, etc.)
- Comprehensive response metadata with processing times and entity counts
- Debug logging for troubleshooting metadata issues

## Database Schema

### Neo4j Nodes (Enhanced with Graphiti)
- **Character**: Historical figures with comprehensive profiles and development arcs
- **Episode**: Story segments with narrative context and semantic embeddings
- **Event**: Historical events with timeline and contextual relationships
- **Entity**: General entities and concepts with semantic understanding

### Neo4j Relationships
- **RELATES_TO**: Enhanced connections between entities with contextual facts
- **MENTIONS**: Links between episodes and entities with relevance scoring
- **Graphiti Semantic**: Embedded relationship understanding via OpenAI vectors

### Graphiti Integration
- **Semantic Episodes**: Content with vector embeddings for conceptual search
- **Entity Relationships**: Fact-based connections with embedded understanding
- **Temporal Context**: Time-aware semantic search capabilities

## Configuration

### Neo4j Connection
- URI: `bolt://localhost:7687`
- Database: `the-great-fire-db`
- Auth: neo4j/Sk1pper(())

### Ollama Settings (Optimized for Quality)
- Model: `mistral-small3.1:latest`
- URL: `http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions`
- Max Tokens: 1200
- Temperature: 0.6 (increased from 0.4 for less repetition)
- Frequency Penalty: 0.8 (reduced from 1.0)
- Presence Penalty: 0.4 (reduced from 0.6)

### OpenAI Integration (For Semantic Search)
- Model: `gpt-4o-mini` (for Graphiti operations)
- Embedding Model: `text-embedding-3-small`
- Used for: Semantic search, query analysis, content compression
- Fallback: System works without OpenAI key (Neo4j only mode)

## Server Details

- **Host**: 0.0.0.0
- **Main Endpoint**: `/api/analyze`
- **Health Check**: `/api/health`
- **Capabilities**: `/api/capabilities`

## Goals & Next Steps

### Completed Goals
1. âœ… Fix repetitive answer generation
2. âœ… Improve answer quality and style
3. âœ… Implement hybrid semantic search with Graphiti
4. âœ… Enhance compression and performance optimization
5. âœ… Complete metadata tracking and response format
6. âœ… Set up comprehensive documentation and migration scripts

### Current Tasks
1. ðŸ”„ Resolve Graphiti fulltext index requirements
2. ðŸ”„ Test semantic search functionality thoroughly
3. ðŸ”„ Compare semantic vs manual search result quality

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Merge graphiti-integration branch after validation
- [ ] Implement answer caching for common queries
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Expand database with additional historical sources
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and optimization
- [ ] Advanced thematic analysis capabilities

## Historical Context
The system specializes in analyzing "The Great Fire of Smyrna" (1922), focusing on:
- Character relationships and development
- Historical events and their consequences  
- International diplomatic interactions
- Humanitarian crisis and relief efforts
- Cultural and political tensions of the period

## Technical Notes
- **Primary Architecture**: Hybrid Graphiti semantic search + Neo4j manual fallback
- **LLM Integration**: Local Ollama for answer generation (privacy-focused)
