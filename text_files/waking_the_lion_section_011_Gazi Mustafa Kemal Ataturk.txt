11. Gazi Mustafa Kemal Ataturk

GAZI MUSTAFA KEMAL ATATURK
The Father of the Turks
A
nyone interested to know more about this extraordinary leader should read
Andrew Mango’s book Ataturk. That is the definitive biography. Andrew
Mango, Ataturk, (Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press, 2002)
However, another insightful book and very interesting read is Gray Wolf.
H.C. Armstrong, Gray Wolf, (New York: Minton, Balch & Company, 1933)
This book was banned in Turkey for years, but is available now.
I will not attempt to tell what has already been told. However, the regular
meetings my Grandfather and Father had with the great leader provide some
understanding to his greatness.
First, the photo President Ataturk gave to my Grandfather has his
monogram at the top of the frame: GMK. That stands for Gazi Mustafa
Kemal. He had not yet been bestowed with the family name of Ataturk by the
Legislature of Turkey. He personally signed the photo as “Gazi M. Kemal.”
What is so interesting about this fact in 1931 is that he was President of
Turkey, but he did not sign has name as President. Turkey would have many
presidents, but only one Gazi. He was proud of the title. The title signified
that he was both the exceptional military leader in charge of all Turkish
forces and the distinguished diplomat who directed all foreign relations.
